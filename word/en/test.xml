Create a word table showing the Lemma for each word.
The entries in the table are Word, Lemma, Part of Speech, Tense, Mood and Note.

* Decompose the contraction in Lemma.
* Leave blank if not applicable.
* Words linked by an apostrophe should be separated.
* The Note should be writtern in brief, e.g. archaic.
* Quotation marks should be excluded. Apostrophes in contractions are not quotation marks.
* If the verb and the other word are combined, they should be separated by Lemma.
  In such cases, only the verb information should be written in the other columns.
