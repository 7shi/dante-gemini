**Note:** The etymology of "name" is uncertain, but it is thought to be related to the Proto-Germanic word *namo*, which is also the source of the Old Norse word *nafn* and the German word *Name*. The etymology of "himself" is more straightforward, as it is a combination of the Old English words "hine" (meaning "him") and "selfne" (meaning "self").
