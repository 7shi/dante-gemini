Please note that the etymologies provided are for the most part the ultimate etymologies, meaning the words from which the Old English, Old French, or Latin words are derived. For example, the etymology of "horrible" is given as Latin "horribilis", but "horribilis" is itself derived from the Latin word "horrere", meaning "to shudder".
