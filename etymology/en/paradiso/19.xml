**Note:** The etymology of "penetrate" is ultimately from the Latin "penitus", meaning "inwardly" or "deeply". However, the word "penetrate" entered English via Old French, where it took the form "penetrer". Therefore, the "Derived" column for "penetrate" is Old French, even though the ultimate etymology is Latin.
