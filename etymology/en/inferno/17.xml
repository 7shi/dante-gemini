**Note:** The etymology of "Paduan" and "Florentine" are adjectives derived from the names of the cities Padua and Florence, respectively. The etymology of "sovereign" and "cavalier" are derived from Old French words, which in turn are derived from Latin words. The etymology of "deafen" is derived from the Old English word "deaf," which is related to the Latin word "surdus."
