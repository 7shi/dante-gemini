**Note:** The etymology of "Catalan" is ultimately from the Greek word "Gothia," meaning "land of the Goths." However, the word "Catalan" itself is derived from the Latin word "Catalanus," which is derived from the Greek word "Gothia." Therefore, the etymology of "Catalan" is ultimately Greek, but the word itself is derived from Latin.
